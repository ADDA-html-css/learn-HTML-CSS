    <p>"Okay, but I don't know what to say. Lorenzo, where're you keys? He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous.

Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?"<p>
