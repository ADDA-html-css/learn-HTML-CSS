- Show how to drag the whole folder to Sublime so students have all files.
- Open up donow folder, have students give answer to the Getting Started task. Open in Chrome to check code.

## Advanced Selectors

## Color
Run through basic Slides

Primary colors are used as the basis for all colors.

On the web, we use red green and blue for the basis of all colors. These are expressed by either rgb or hex values.

There are 4 basic color schemes that designers use. Show using [Adobe Color App](https://color.adobe.com/).
- Triad
- Split Complimentary
- Analogous
- Monochromatic

When designing, colors can tell a story.
- Think about your audience.
- What feelings do you want to convey?
- Colors can draw attention to elements and create emphasis.

### Live Code
- Show how to apply color as an rgb and hex value

### Exercise
Tell a story using a color scheme.
- Remix `exercises/color.html` and `exercises/.css`
- Later, Go over the exercise with students, take just their css and put it up, see if people can guess the emotion.

### Live Code
- Show how to add a font from google font.
- Show how to apply in sublime, using the `<link>` from html and font family property in css

``` css
  width: 900px;
