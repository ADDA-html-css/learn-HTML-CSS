#Course Syllabus
*ADDA 2016 - HTML/CSS*

##Objectives
- I design and code modern, attractive, and valid websites using HTML and CSS.
- I can begin to implement JQuery to design user interactions.

## Class Expectations
As students, you are expected to come to every class on time and prepared. In class you are expected to engage in class discussions and excercises. You should communicate with your instructor any needs that you may have. If you must miss a class, let the instructor know prior to the session. If you feel that you are falling behind you need to seek help from either your peers, ADDA alums, or your instructor.

As with any learning experience, you are going to get out of this course what you put in. To that end you should grapple with all in class excercises, homework assignments, and challenge problems. By the end of this course, you will be able to build a great website. This is no small feat.
