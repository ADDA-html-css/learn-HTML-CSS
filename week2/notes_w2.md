## Mini-Lesson 1, classes
```html
<div id="header">
	<h1>Class v. IDs</p>
</div>

<div class="red">
	<p>red text<p>
	<p class="blue">red text?</p>
</div>

<h2 class="red">A red header</h2>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" class="red">A red link</a>
```

- There should be only one of any given ID
- There can be multiple classes
- Analogy: You have an ID, there is no one else should share your ID. You are in this class, but many people can share this class.
